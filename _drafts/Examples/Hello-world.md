Easy! Let's try to embedd a youtube video. This seems to be not so straightforward in Jekyll but I found a [cool link](http://redlegion.org/2012/03/31/Jekyll-and-youtube-embedding/) that seems to make it quite easy.

Well, this works but the size does not match with the rest of the page. *Need review* A likely solution for responsive youtube embedding is found [here](http://brettterpstra.com/2013/01/20/jekyll-tag-plugin-for-responsive-youtube-video-embeds/)
